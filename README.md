# Escape the ANSI Escape Code hellhole

This project aims to provide small, easily mantainable "libraries" allowing developers to add some flair to their CLI apps through ANSI Escape Codes (AEC) without the need to actually manage those codes.

Supported languages:
  * `sh` &mdash; command language:
    * `zsh`
  * Python 3

This section will be expanded as needed, but there is a rule I intend to mantain:

  1. All AEC descriptors must be the same across supported languages as long as it is feasible or possible.
  2. Each supported language must have at least one dedicated branch.
  3. The branch `dev` is to have the current status of all supported languages.
  4. Changes to be merged to `main` are to be done exclusively through Pull Requests.
